  description: |
    Publish may be used for handling publication lists for research
    institutions and departments, or for individual
    researchers. Publish imports publication metadata (title, author,
    year of publication etc), validates the imported data against a
    database of known venues, checks for missing attributes, corrects
    common errors etc, and allows simple filtering and generation of
    publication lists.
